<a id="about"></a>
# 📖About 
- Sketch Party is a real-time sketching platform that allows users to create, join, and collaborate in rooms with shared canvases. Additionally, users can chat while in the room to keep conversations flowing!

- This project was born out of my curiosity about how such collaborative platforms work and my desire to create one from scratch.
